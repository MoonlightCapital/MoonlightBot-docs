The new key will overlap the old one, additionally, you'll become the representative.

#### If I have any temporary action still ongoing and my premium expires, what happens?

They will completed when told to. The premium bot won't leave the server until all temporary actions are completed.

There's a three days grace period. After that, commands will not work anymore until premium is reactivated.

Contact Staff so your data can be transferred from one bot to another.

#### Can I gift MoonlightBot Premium to another server?

Yes, we now support this and you can get up to two gift subs at once for half the price of the tier each. For example, you can get the Advanced tier subscription for yourself plus a gift for $15. You can then use the gift on yourself or give it to someone else if you wish. This perk applies to the Advanced and Super tiers only.
