* `vote-reminders`: This subcommand will remind you daily to [vote for MoonlightBot.](/MoonlightBot-docs/support/upvote-moonlightbot.md)
* `locale`: This subcommand lets you choose what language you want your notifications to be in. For example, if you live in Canada, you can set the locale to French or English.
