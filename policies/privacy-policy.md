## Test Instance Monitoring

The app known as "MoonlightBot test#1483" with ID `546586902728540191` additionally stores in the database some data in order to display it to testers themselves, Staff, helpers and some authorized senior-ranking peer testers. This collection is done to:

- Provide insights about a tester's own activity
- Indicate how much progress has been made
- Assist testers with personalized advice
- Generate a summary of each individual tester's performance and total coverages of the features that required testing

Specifically, the data stored is:

- Names, timestamps and permissions of the commands being used
- Versions of the app used throughout a testing session
- Timestamps of last used commands
- For each command usage, a SHA-256 fingerprint, part of which generated is with the full options of the command used as input
