## 1 - Protect your Account

You must take adequate measures to protect your account and any third party account used in connection to our services from unauthorized access.

If you know or suspect anyone else other than you to have access to your account, you must notify us promptly and provide a detailed explanation of the events leading up to the unauthorized access, and steps taken to regain full control over it.

## 2 - Respect Third Party Platforms

You must not use our services to violate, or or make us appear in violation the policies and regulations of third parties used by our services.

This includes, but is not limited to Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) or [Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy).

## 3 - Respect our Volunteers

MoonlightBot is ran by [volunteers](../support/volunteering.md). The regulations in this section ensure that volunteering with us remains a pleasant, satisfactory and positive experience. If you are involved in our volunteer activities, our [Volunteer Code of Conduct](volunteer-code-of-conduct.md) applies in addition to this policy.

1. **Do not harass volunteers:** Any form of harassment, bullying, or disrespectful behavior towards volunteers is strictly prohibited. This includes derogatory comments, personal attacks, or any action meant to cause emotional or psychological harm, distress or anxiety.
2. **Do not make unreasonable demands or expectations:** Volunteers have limitations and commitments outside of their volunteer role. You must not make unreasonable demands or require immediate responses at all times.
3. **Do not disrupt or sabotage the service:** You must not disrupt the work or sabotage the efforts of our volunteers. This includes intentional interference, spreading false information, or engaging in malicious activities that hinder our ability to perform our duties effectively or enjoy the results of our work.
4. **Do not diminish or vilify the work of volunteers:** You must not take any action or omission that diminishes or vilifies the efforts of our volunteers. Our developers, translators, quality control testers, documentation writers and other officially recognized collaborators are hard-working, so we request that you relation with them in an understanding, collaborative, and accepting manner. This includes but is not limited to displays of indifference about sensitive topics such as struggles faced in their process of expanding and relating with our volunteer team, engaging with our users, and the finding and maintaining of resources, as well as personal hardships.
5. **Do not mislead our support team:** You must not submit any false or malicious report, application, request, statement or interaction to our volunteers while acting in official capacity. You are responsible for correcting and updating us on the validity of any of your previous statements in clear writing before taking any action that can be reasonably believed to be falsifying.

## 10 - Policy Enforcement

3. All appeal outcomes are final, not subject to further dispute, and waive your privilege to submit any other appeals regarding the same infraction.
