# List of Log Names  

Logs, categorized by what they do are listed here, and are **case sensitive**. Individual logs are written in _UPPER\_CASE_, while category names (which can be used in place of individual log names, see [_**configuring channels**_](../management-commands/config.md)) are _Capitalized_. Each one of them is separated by categories in the lists below. To log all events, use an asterisk (`*`). All logs require the bot to have permission to view and send messages, embed links and attach files in the respective channels. Some logs require the bot to have the "View Audit Log" permission enabled at server level.  

## Moderation

This category is to log actions taken by moderators. Most of them are triggered by using bot commands, but those starting with `AUDIT_` will read the data from Discord's audit log providing MoonlightBot has permission to do so.
