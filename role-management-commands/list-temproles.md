# list-temproles

This command allows you to view all active temporary roles and paused roles in the server. It will display the user,
role, and the time remaining for each temporary/paused role.

{% hint style="info" %}
For information on how to assign a temporary role to a user, refer to
the [`temprole`](../role-management-commands/temprole.md#temprole) command and
for information on how to pause a role for a user, refer to
the [`pause-role`](../role-management-commands/pause-role.md#pause-role) command.

If an entry is shown as *Unsustained* it means that the conditions to sustain the role are currently not being met by the moderator who added the temporary action.
