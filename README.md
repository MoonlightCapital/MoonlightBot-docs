# MoonlightBot Documentation

MoonlightBot is a powerful Discord bot designed to help server moderation without bloat. It features extremely customizable logging, easy to use commands, management of temporary actions, and much much more to make your server life easier.

## Getting started

The first step in using MoonlightBot is to invite it to your server. [Click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=314110696071888896\&scope=bot+applications.commands\&permissions=470150342) for a link that lets you invite the bot with all permissions it requires to work.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only servers in which you have **Manage Server **permission will show there.

The bot can still work without its managed role, but some commands may not work if proper permissions are not set.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Feel good and want early access to new things? Check out [MoonlightBot beta](versions-of-the-bot/beta.md).
{% endhint %}

### Commands

You can use MoonlightBot's commands by sending a Slash Command. We're currently removing support for legacy prefixes, due to changes being made by Discord.

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide will always use the default prefix which will not change and cannot be removed for clarity. If you are using other versions of the bot, adjust the prefix accordingly.

Use `/help <name of a command>` to know how to use a command, as well as to know if the command exists.
{% endhint %}

### Configuration

Once the bot is added into the server, you can start using commands straight away.

By default, there's nothing to configure to use the core features, but if you want to set permissions for commands, or log actions, or use a custom prefix etc, you can edit all of that with the `config` command. A detailed explanation of this command can be found [at the command's page](admin-commands/config/).
