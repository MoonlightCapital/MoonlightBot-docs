{% endhint %}

### Subcommands

#### Set

This command adds pairs to the group (a pair being an emoji connect to a role). A group can have a maximum of 20 pairs.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/ReactionRoleSetup2.png>)

The required arguments for this option are `group`, `emoji`, and `role`. `Group` is the group that you want to apply pairs to and `emoji` is the emoji you want the user to react with to toggle the `role`.

#### Delete

This deletes a given group (`group` is the required argument.).

{% hint style="danger" %}
This action is irreversible. You will be allowed to create a new group with the same name as a deleted group.
{% endhint %}

#### Info

Takes a group name as required argument, and shows some information, such as the emoji/role couples and settings for the group.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can edit group options with the `config` command
{% endhint %}

#### List

This option lists all the available groups by name and amount of roles set. No arguments required.

#### Autorepair

This removes any deleted emoji/role from the group (the only required argument), cleaning things up. It will not search for deleted messages.

{% hint style="info" %}
There is an optional argument (`disconnect-messages`) that removes the group from all messages it is applied to. This is meant to be used if a group reaches the maximum of 5 messages and one of the messages are deleted (you can't remove a message from a group if it's deleted). 
{% endhint %}

/reaction-roles set <group> <emoji> <role>
