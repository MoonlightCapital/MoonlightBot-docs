# Volunteer Opportunities

## Tester

MoonlightBot testers act as the guardians of quality in the bot development process. They carefully examine new updates with a special copy of the bot, functioning as the voice of the end user.

Their mission is to uncover bugs and annoyances that might hinder a smooth user experience, before they even reach the Beta release. This collaborative spirit ensures that issues are reported and then effectively addressed by the developer, making MoonlightBot not only functional but also enjoyable and user-friendly!

### Benefits

### Becoming a Tester

The tester community programme is currently by invitation only. To ensure a minimum standard of quality and fairness, we accept members who are on the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/hNQWVVC). It helps your chances of receiving an invitation from a Staff member if you follow the rules, send messages, and support MoonlightBot in other ways.
