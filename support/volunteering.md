# Volunteer Opportunities

MoonlightBot is exclusively ran by volunteers - yes, even the developer - and we will be glad to accept you as part of our team! No coding skills required. In this page, you will find all the positions and tasks we are looking for.

Volunteering is a nice way to show your support for our charitable activities, connect with the community, and hone your server management skills. We offer generous benefits for all our volunteers akin to those of Premium subscribers.

## Tester

MoonlightBot testers act as the keepers of quality in the bot development process. They carefully examine new updates with a special copy of the bot, functioning as the voice of the end user.

Their mission is to uncover bugs and annoyances that might hinder a smooth user experience, before they even reach the Beta release. This collaborative spirit ensures that issues are reported and then effectively addressed by the developer, making MoonlightBot not only functional but also enjoyable and user-friendly!

### Benefits

* A colorful, prominent role in the server to show everyone you're one of us
* MoonlightBot Premium subscription (Advanced tier, duration varies based on your contributions)
* An opportunity to learn how to get the most from MoonlightBot - and many other Discord apps
* Access to and testing of new features as they are developed
* The ability to request small changes, work closely with the developer, and have a voice in important decisions
* Your name on the [Special Thanks Page](/special-thanks.md#testers)

### Becoming a Tester

The tester community programme is currently by invitation only. To ensure a minimum standard of quality and fairness, we accept members who are on the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/hNQWVVC). It helps your chances of receiving an invitation from a Staff member if you follow the rules, send messages, and support MoonlightBot in other ways.

When we send you an invitation, we have already done our due diligence in ensuring you already follow the requirements for the position.

## Translator

MoonlightBot translators assist in translating the commands, responses and messages shown when interacting with the bot.

### Benefits

* A colorful, prominent role in the server to show everyone you're one of us
* MoonlightBot Premium (Basic tier), once you have translated 50 strings
* Your name on the [Special Thanks Page](/special-thanks.md#translators)

### Becoming a Translator

To become a translator, you need to possess the following requirements:

* You must be a native (or near-native) speaker of the language you're applying for
* You must have a level of English comparable to B1 or higher in the [CEFR scale](<https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045bb52>)
* You must be at least 16 years old
* You (or the server you represent) must have used MoonlightBot for more than two weeks
* You must not have any significative infraction history

If you meet the requirements above (some can be skipped in certain cases with Staff consent), you can then apply in the `#apply-for-translator` channel in the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/hNQWVVC). There you will find a button to press and fill out the application form.

Your application will be looked at, and if we're satisfied that you'd make a good candidate, we will create a private thread and ask you to complete a few short translation trials. If you pass the trial, we will give you full access to the translation program. This means you can get translating straight ahead! Usually this process takes less than 24 hours.

## Documentation Writer

Documentation writers are the volunteers who take care of this very documentation website, and provide the information that users need to use MoonlightBot. They describe the bot's features and commands in detail, more than possibly allowed by Discord's technical limitations.

They create new documentation pages as new functions are added to the bot, and update existing pages to reflect changes, to allow MoonlightBot's single developer to only focus on making the changes, which improves the productivity rate at which new features come out.

### Benefits

* A colorful, prominent role in the server to show everyone you're one of us
* The tester role (necessary to access their channels, the two roles work closely)
* A MoonlightBot Premium subscription (Super tier)
* Access to and testing of new features as they are developed
* Earliest possible access to upcoming updates
* Your name on the [Special Thanks Page](/special-thanks.md#documentation-writers)

### Becoming a Documentation Writer

Anyone can fork and submit pull requests to the [Documentation GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MoonlightCapital/MoonlightBot-docs/), however, we are looking for a team of maintainers who systematically expand, correct, and improve the documentation on guidance of the team, led by their caretaker.

There are a handful of ways to join the official Doc Writers team and received the benefits listed above:

1. **Voluntary Contributions:** If you provide helpful advice or suggest edits - whether in the server or via pull requests - the documentation caretaker (who will always be a member of our Staff) will contact you directly to invite you as a writer
2. **Submitting an Application:** If we feel the need to expand our team, we may open applications for doc writers. When we do, we announce that in our server with instructions on how to apply. Be on the lookout for when these opportunities come up as we will likely mention `@everyone`

New writers are be subject to a trial period, usually lasting two weeks, where they are asked to complete a task to determine their fitness for the program. If we're sufficiently satisfied with your performance, we will welcome you with full benefits.

To be a documentation writer, you should fulfill the following requirements:

* You must have a level of English comparable to B2 or higher in the [CEFR scale](<https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045bb52>)
* You must be at least 16 years old
* You must demonstrate an understanding of Markdown and GitBook formatting
* You must have been a user of MoonlightBot (based on date of first recorded interaction) for at least 1 month
* You must demonstrate strong attention to detail and proofreading skills
* You must not have any significative infraction history
