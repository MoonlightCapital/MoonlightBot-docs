# Volunteer Opportunities

MoonlightBot is exclusively ran by volunteers - yes, even the developer - and we will be glad to accept you as part of our team! No coding skills required. In this page, you will find all the positions and roles we are looking to have on board.

Volunteering is a nice way to show your support for our charitable activities, connect with the community, and hone your server management skills. We offer generous benefits for all our volunteers akin to those of Premium subscribers.

## Tester

MoonlightBot testers act as quality control in the development process. They carefully examine new updates with a special copy of the bot, functioning as a representative sample of end users.

Tests do not impact your server as the MoonlightBot test instance is added in small private testing servers following the instructions provided by the program manager and your peers.

Their mission is to uncover bugs and annoyances that might hinder a smooth user experience, before they even reach the Beta release. This collaborative spirit ensures that issues are reported and then effectively addressed by the developer, making MoonlightBot not only functional but also enjoyable and user-friendly!

We care a lot about releasing nearly-perfectly working updates, therefore we generously reward testers who find impactful bugs or propose changes that end up being appreciated with **virtual gift cards** you can choose from so we can fuel your passions!

As you make experience as a tester, you will be promoted to the higher tiers of **Specialist Tester** and then **Master Tester**, each of which provides more permissions and privileges that you can use to assist your team.

### Benefits

* A colorful, prominent role in the server to show everyone you're one of us
* Advanced Tier MoonlightBot Premium subscription
* Virtual gift cards of your choice for finding major bugs or suggesting useful changes
* An opportunity to learn how to get the most from MoonlightBot and many other Discord apps
* The ability to request small changes, work closely with the developer, and have a voice in important decisions
* Your name on the [Special Thanks Page](special-thanks.md#testers)

### Becoming a Tester

The tester community program is currently accessible by invitation only. We will contact you if you are in the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/hNQWVVC) and catch the Staff's attention by, for example, following rules, [upvote](upvote-moonlightbot.md), report issues, submit or support suggestions.

## Translator

MoonlightBot translators assist in translating the commands, responses and messages shown when interacting with the bot.

### Benefits

* A colorful, prominent role in the server to show everyone you're one of us
* MoonlightBot Premium (Basic tier), once you have translated 50 strings
* Your name on the [Special Thanks Page](special-thanks.md#translators)

### Becoming a Translator

To become a translator, you need to possess the following requirements:

* You must be a native (or near-native) speaker of the language you're applying for
* You must have a level of English comparable to B1 or higher in the [CEFR scale](<https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045bb52>)
* You must be at least 16 years old
* You (or the server you represent) must have used MoonlightBot for more than two weeks
* You must not have any significative infraction history

If you meet the requirements above (some can be skipped in certain cases with Staff consent), you can then apply in the `#apply-for-translator` channel in the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/hNQWVVC). There you will find a button to press and fill out the application form.

Your application will be looked at, and if we're satisfied that you'd make a good candidate, we will create a private thread and ask you to complete a few short translation trials. If you pass the trial, we will give you full access to the translation program. This means you can get translating straight ahead! Usually this process takes less than 24 hours.

## Documentation Writer

Documentation writers are the volunteers who take care of this very documentation website, and provide the information that users need to use MoonlightBot. They describe the bot's features and commands in detail, more than possibly allowed by Discord's technical limitations.

They create new documentation pages as new functions are added to MoonlightBot, and update existing pages to reflect changes, to allow MoonlightBot's sole developer to only focus on making the changes, which improves the productivity rate at which new features come out.

### Benefits

* A colorful, prominent role in the server to show everyone you're one of us
* The tester role (necessary to access their channels, the two roles work closely)
* A MoonlightBot Premium subscription (Super tier)
* Virtual gift cards, similarly to testers
* Access to and testing of new features as they are developed
* Earliest possible access to upcoming updates
* Your name on the [Special Thanks Page](special-thanks.md#documentation-writers)

### Becoming a Documentation Writer

Anyone can fork and submit pull requests to the [Documentation GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MoonlightCapital/MoonlightBot-docs/), however, we are looking for a team of active maintainers who systematically expand, correct, and improve the documentation on guidance of the team, led by their caretaker.

There are a handful of ways to join the official Doc Writers team and received the benefits listed above:

1. **Voluntary Contributions:** If you provide helpful advice or suggest edits - whether in the server or via pull requests - the documentation caretaker (who will always be a member of our Staff) will contact you directly to invite you as a writer
2. **Submitting an Application:** If we feel the need to expand our team, we may open applications for doc writers. When we do, we announce that in our server with instructions on how to apply. Be on the lookout for when these opportunities come up as we will likely mention `@everyone`

New writers are be subject to a trial period, usually lasting two weeks, where they are asked to complete a task to determine their fitness for the program. If we're sufficiently satisfied with your performance, we will welcome you with full benefits.

To be a documentation writer, you should fulfill the following requirements:

* You must have a level of English comparable to B2 or higher in the [CEFR scale](<https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045bb52>)
* You must be at least 16 years old
* You must demonstrate an understanding of Markdown and GitBook formatting
* You must have been a user of MoonlightBot (based on date of first recorded interaction) for at least 1 month
* You must demonstrate strong attention to detail and proofreading skills
* You must not have any significative infraction history
