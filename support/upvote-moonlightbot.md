# Upvote MoonlightBot

By upvoting MoonlightBot on bot listing sites, you help us reach a wider audience and speed up the development of new features, as well as improve the support system.

## Why should you vote? And how does it help us?

1. If we helped you or your server, you should vote so that other people can discover MoonlightBot's amazing features!
2. Knowing you're supporting our work makes us motivated to do better. With more motivation, we can quickly ship new features to the bot!
3. Some people are full of hatred, and they like to attack small bot developers like us. But your votes make us more resilient and allow us to continue offering the service.

## Perks/Rewards for voting

For your first ever vote or after a 30 consecutive days of voting, you will receive one free week of [MoonlightBot Premium](../support/premium.md). The bot will DM you with a button to claim it.
By having voted in the past 72 hours, your max durations will be doubled. Voting also extends your premium duration by 48 hours. Be sure to vote for MoonlightBot often!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure you allow Direct Messages from a mutual server so MoonlightBot can message you, otherwise you won't be able to claim your free week of Premium!
