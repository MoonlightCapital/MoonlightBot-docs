## Methods to get Premium

{% hint style="info" %}
All methods require you to be in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/hNQWVVC). Please join before continuing.
{% endhint %}

### Subscribe on Patreon

Patreon is a platform we use to manage subscriptions. You can pledge at [https://www.patreon.com/MoonlightCapital](https://www.patreon.com/MoonlightCapital) to get started. See below for a full description of the content of each tier.

### Upvote MoonlightBot

You can upvote MoonlightBot and earn some free Premium. For more information, see the [voting tutorial](upvote-moonlightbot.md).

For your first ever vote, or for voting consecutively for 30 days, you will receive one week of Basic tier Premium. This will be prolonged as long as you continue voting at least once every 48 hours.

### Boost the support server

For [boosting the support server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-FAQ-#h\_9dfb44db-c394-4339-863b-e6d1e3fb0469) you will receive your Premium subscription after having answered a few questions, a security briefing and entering an agreement.

The Premium tier for Server Boosting is initially Basic and will be upgraded to Advanced tier once you have boosted for three months consecutively.

If the server boost level is under Level 2 (less than 7 boosts) at the time you add the boost, and you can guarantee to boost the server for at least one month ahead, you will be immediately start from Advanced tier. This deal is to help keeping the Support Server at Boost Level 2 for its important perks without interruption and recover level losses.

When this occurs, an announcement will be posted and a relevant note will appear in MoonlightBot's command responses. Watch out for those so you don't miss the deal!

You will also receive the **Booster** role in the server, so everyone can see your special way of supporting us.

### Giveaways, volunteering, and other rewards

In the support server, we may run giveaways or offer [volunteering opportunities](volunteering.md) - such as translating MoonlightBot into other languages, providing feedback, or reporting bugs to earn Premium subscriptions as reward. Join the server to find out more about the specifics of those types of subscription as terms and conditions may vary.

## How to activate your Premium subscription

Activating your subscription is a seamless process that only requires four steps to complete:

1. In the support server, check your privacy settings (from desktop: right click the server icon; from mobile: tap the tree dots at the top next to the server name and scroll down). Make sure you set to allow direct messages from server members. This is important as you will soon receive a direct message from MoonlightBot (or the premium one, depending on your selected tier) confirming your subscription was activated successfully
2. If your settings are configured correctly but have not received any message within 12 hours, reach out to the Staff team for assistance

3. **Verify the bot is legitimate** by clicking on the bot name to view information. The main instance of MoonlightBot has a verified check mark next to the username and was created on March 18th, 2018. The Premium instance also has a verified check mark next to the username and was created on March 27, 2020.

4. If the bot is legitimate, click on the "Add me to your server" button at the end of the confirmation message. Make sure you **do not uncheck** the "View Audit Log" permission in the procedure, as that is required to verify it was you who added the bot and mark you as representative

Done!

## Custom commands

We can now create custom commands in your servers! They can combine parts of already existing commands, or even provide unique functionality to improve automation for your servers.

As those custom commands are tailored for your experience, they will have to be developed on the fly at your request. This may usually take up to a week for your commands to be available.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All custom features must comply with Discord's [Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy) and [Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-terms-of-service).
{% endhint %}

For any question regarding custom commands, or to get started with their development, please contact a Staff member in our support server and we will be happy to assist you as best as we can.

## Premium Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I lose bot configuration and other data by switching to Premium?

Absolutely not! The server administrator can use the `/transfer data` command to transfer data from the free version of MoonlightBot to Premium. Transferrals are free and instant.

### If I have any temporary action still ongoing and my subscription expires, what happens?

They will be removed normally even beyond expiration date, providing the Premium bot is still in the server.

### Can I gift MoonlightBot Premium to another server?

Unfortunately, at the moment we do not support gifting subscriptions.

### Do you still offer lifetime subscriptions?

We decided to remove the lifetime subscription tier from Patreon due to its confusing nature. Lifetime subscriptions are now only offered as a token of appreciation for excellent conduct with the service, and for volunteers (and former) who helped with making MoonlightBot what it is now.

If you purchased or received a lifetime subscription in the past, it will remain available.

## Disclaimer

Premium subscribers are subject to the [Resource provider agreement](/policies/acceptable-use-policy.md#6---resource-providerdonation-policy) of the [Acceptable Use Policy](/policies/acceptable-use-policy.md).

All perks are meant to come "within reason". We will turn down requests that cause excessive strain on our systems, personnel or come with certain caveats that may not be appropriate for our ecosystem. In doubt, consult our Staff first.

Premium perks are tied to server representatives being in the support server. This requirement is in place to have a mutual point of contact to respond to your inquiries and for us to reach out to you in case of important updates or feedback about the service. Leaving the server or getting removed for breaking rules will result in an automatic termination of your subscription. This requirement may be waived on occasion only by previous agreement.
