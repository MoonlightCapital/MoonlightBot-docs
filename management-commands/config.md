# config

The `config` command allows you to configure all settings for the server, such as roles, channels, reaction roles,
and other customizable behavior of MoonlightBot. To get the current configuration of a setting, just use the
corresponding sub command without any optional arguments.

{% hint style="info" %}
If an argument provides you with the option `Open Editor` like the argument `custom-notification-text` of
the [`roles on-expire`](../management-commands/config.md#on-expire) command, it means that a modal textbox will open for
you to input your desired text.
<br>
All default values are either `0`, `false` or empty for their respective arguments, unless stated otherwise.
{% endhint %}
