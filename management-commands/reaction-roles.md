# reaction-roles

This command allows you to set up reaction roles in your server. Reaction roles allow users to assign/remove roles
to/from themselves by reacting to specific messages that server admins set up. There are several customization options
to optimize your needs.

roles. For a tutorial on how to set them up, refer to the respective [guide](../start-up/setting-up-reaction-roles.md).

## autorepair

This command automatically "repairs" errors in a group. With "repair" is meant that it will remove the IDs of roles that
do not exist anymore from the pairings.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The `disconnect-messages` option is a dangerous option to use and only should be used if you know what you are doing.
It is a disruptive operation and will make reaction roles on messages to which this group was applied non-functional.
They need to be reapplied appropriately afterwards to work again.

If you only want to remove a group from a message, right-click the message and select "Remove reaction roles" instead.
